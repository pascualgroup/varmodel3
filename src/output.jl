"""
This file defines types and functions for database output.

Currently, it is shared across model variants, but in the future may need to be
broken up to be variant-specific.

The `write_output!()` function defined here calls three functions defined by the
code for individual model variants:

* `write_summary()`: writes out summary data
* `write_host_samples()`: writes out sampled hosts and infections
* `write_gene_strain_counts()`: writes out gene and strain counts

There is a sophisticated Julia system called Tables.jl that would allow the code
here to be less repetitive. With the goal of not introducing too many layers
of abstraction, this code uses SQLite more directly; a future Julia-oriented
maintainer may want to convert the code.
