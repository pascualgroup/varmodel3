*Var* gene evolution model(s), implemented in Julia.
Based on previous C++ implementations ([varmodel](https://github.com/pascualgroup/varmodel) and [varmodel2](https://github.com/pascualgroup/varmodel2) by [Ed Baskerville](https://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/people/ed-baskerville/) and [Qixin He](https://www.qixinhe.net/?_ga=2.130167695.167565966.1656355847-504625709.1649177406). This code implements a model of malaria *var* gene evolution within an individual-based disease transmission model. Malaria strains are represented as unordered sets of *var* genes, which are in turn composed of abstract loci. A number of alleles can appear at each locus, and the allelic composition of a gene across loci governs immune dynamics in the host. Individual hosts are infected by strains, and infections can be transmitted between hosts. Each infection expresses a single *var* gene at a time, and the sequence of expressions is explicitly represented in the simulation. The simulation also includes immigration of new strains into the population, recombination during transmission and during an infection, and mutation. The simulation is modeled as a sequence of discrete events (state changes) that happen in continuous time. Model details are described inline in comments in the code; see *Code Organization* below to get oriented.

## Quickstart

### Setup

Before doing anything, run the following command line to install the packages required by this code:
```julia
./install-packages.jl
```

### Single runs

* A single ad-hoc run of the model, directly in Julia and without an external parameters file, is convenient for testing. Instead of using the standard `run.jl`, which loads parameters from JSON, you generate parameters inside Julia and run the model code directly with them. To do a single ad-hoc run of the model, do the following:
  1. Copy the script `examples/julia/run.jl` into a new directory,
  2. Modify the relative paths to `preamble.jl` and `model.jl`,
  3. Modify the parameter values,
  4. Run the script: `julia run.jl`, or directly as a shell script, `./run.jl`.

* To perform a run with an existing parameters file in JSON format, copy the parameters file into a new experiment directory, and use the script `varmodel3/run.jl` as described in the comment string. To see how to generate parameters from JSON, see the code embedded in the example for parameter sweeps (`examples/sweep/generate-sweep.jl`).

### Parameter sweeps

To do a parameter sweep, copy the `examples/sweep` directory, and modify/run as described in the comment string in `generate-sweep.jl`. This script loops through parameter combinations, and replicates with different random seeds, and generates files necessary to perform runs on a local machine or on a SLURM cluster. It also divides runs into jobs suitable for execution on a single cluster node or local machine. The runs are specified as lines in the job's `runs.txt` file, and the job is specified in a `job.sbatch` file, which can be run directly as a shell script or submitted to a SLURM cluster. Each job uses the script `varmodel3/runmany.jl` to run a single-node, multi-core queue of runs, with one run running on each core at any time. This script also generates a script `submit_jobs.sh`, which submits every job to SLURM at once. Runs are divided into at most `N_JOBS_MAX` jobs that make use of at most `N_CORES_PER_JOB_MAX` for the cluster node's local queue. This allows you to work within limits set by your cluster administrator. If you have no limits, you should set `N_JOBS_MAX` to a very large number, and set `N_CORES_PER_JOB_MAX = 1`, so that the cluster can dynamically
balance runs across cluster nodes as the experiment runs. To modify configuration settings for SLURM jobs, edit the template string in the `generate_jobs()` function.

## Model overview

In this model, hosts carry infections of different strains of the malaria parasite *Plasmodium falciparum*. Each parasite genome consists of a specific combination (*i.e.,* repertoire) of `n_genes_per_strain` *var* genes. Strain identity is defined by this repertoire independent of order. Although unlikely, the same *var* gene may occur multiple times in a strain. Each *var* gene itself is represented as a linear combination of `n_loci` epitopes, *i.e.,* parts of the molecule that act as antigens and are targeted by the immune system. At the outset, each locus i has one of `n_alleles_per_locus_initial[i]` possible values, indexed from 0 to `n_alleles_per_locus_initial[i] - 1`. Mutation events create new alleles, so the number of distinct alleles at each locus can increase over time. At any time, hosts may be infected multiple times by the same or different strains. The *var* genes in a repertoire are expressed sequentially and the infection ends when the whole repertoire is depleted. The order of expression is randomized distinctly for each infection. The duration of the active period of a *var* gene, and thus of the infection, is determined by the number of unseen epitopes. When a *var* gene is deactivated, the host adds the deactivated *var* gene epitopes to its immunity memory. Specific immunity toward a given epitope experiences a loss rate from host immunity memory, and re-exposure is therefore required to maintain it. The local population is open to immigration from the regional pool.

## History of changes

This code is a new implementation in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) of the malaria *var* gene evolution model which is based on previous C++ implementations (*i.e.,* [varmodel](https://github.com/pascualgroup/varmodel) and [varmodel2](https://github.com/pascualgroup/varmodel2)). The main changes from the previous implementation are as follows:

* While the previous implementations of the stochastic agent-based model (ABM) were adapted from the next-reaction method which optimizes the Gillespie first-reaction method, this implementation uses a simpler [Gillespie algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021999176900413).
* Our model extension allows us to keep track of the neutral part of each migrant parasite genome assembled by sampling one of the two possible alleles at each of a defined number of neutral bi-allelic SNPs.
* While the extended model can generate homogeneous initial SNP allele frequencies by sampling the migrant alleles with an identical probability from the regional pool (*i.e.,* 0.5), it can also generate distinct initial SNP allele frequencies by sampling the migrant alleles from the regional pool with distinct probabilities that sum up to one (*e.g.,* 0.2 and 0.8) and are randomly picked from a defined range (*e.g.,* [0.1-0.9]).
* Moreover, to generate the neutral part of a recombinant parasite and mimic meiotic recombination, which happens within the mosquito during the sexual reproduction stage of the parasite, a random allele is sampled for each bi-allelic SNP.
* Finally, to allow for linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the neutral part of the genome, neutral bi-allelic SNPs can be non-randomly associated and co-segregate as defined in a matrix of LD coefficients indicating the probability that pairs of linked SNPs will co-segregate during the meiotic recombination.
