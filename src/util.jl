Samples an index using weights.

Assumes that `total_weight == sum(weights)`.

The sampling algorithm can be visualized by arranging boxes left to right,
with widths equal to the weights, in sequence, numbered `1:length(weights)`;
the leftmost box has its left edge at 0.

To sample, draw a real number is uniformly randomly in [0, total_weight];
this sampled location corresponds to a point within one of the boxes.
To identify which box, scan the boxes left to right while computing the
cumulative sum.
If the sampled location is less than the cumulative sum, return the index of
the most recently scanned box.
